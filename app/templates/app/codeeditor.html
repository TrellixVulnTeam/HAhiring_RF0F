        <div class="starwars-lab" style="display: inline"><p>Arpasland has surrounded by attackers. A truck enters the city. The driver claims the load is food and medicine from Iranians.&nbsp;Ali is one of the soldiers in Arpasland. He doubts about the&nbsp;truck, maybe it's from the siege. He knows that&nbsp;a&nbsp;tag is valid if the sum of every two consecutive digits of it is even and its letter is not a vowel. Determine if the tag of the truck is valid or not</p>
                       <p>We consider the letters <strong>"A","E","I","O","U","Y</strong>" to be vowels for this problem.</p>
                        <p><strong>Input Format</strong></p>
                      <p>The first line contains a string of length 9. The format is "DDXDDD-DD", where D&nbsp;stands for a digit (non zero) and X is an uppercase english&nbsp;letter.</p>
                  <p><strong>Output Format</strong></p>
            <p>Print "valid" (without quotes) if the tag is valid, print "invalid" otherwise (without quotes)</p>
